# vscode-endwise

This is an extension that wisely adds the "end" keyword to code structures in Ruby while keeping the correct indentation levels, inspired by tpope's [endwise.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise).

Just hit `enter` to get your block automagically closed. `ctrl+enter` / `cmd+enter` closed from the middle of the line as well.

## TODO

- [X] Wisely detect already closed blocks to skip additional "end"'s
- [ ] Add support for more languages (Lua, Bash, etc.)
- [ ] Add a gif with code that actually makes sense ðŸ™„
